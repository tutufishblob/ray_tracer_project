This is a project I am building to learn Rust. 
I enjoy doing linear algebra and I heard from someone who works at Nvidia that building a ray tracer is the best way to learn a language so I thought I would try it out.
This project follows a tutorial from a graphics professor, the tutorial can be found here -> https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#antialiasing.
All code is written by me and translated by me from C++ into Rust.
