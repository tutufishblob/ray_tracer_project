This is a project I am building to learn Rust. 
I enjoy doing linear algebra and I heard from someone who works at Nvidia that building a ray tracer is the best way to learn a language so I thought I would try it out.
This project follows a tutorial from a graphics professor, the tutorial can be found here -> https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.
All code is written by me and translated by me from C++ into Rust.

I will probably not be working on the repo again, I have used it for what I wanted to get out of it. I'm currently trying to build a GPU optimized voxel engine from scratch and that will probably be my main focus for the time being. 

I think in the future if I come back to ray tracing I will need to write a new one. I have learned a lot from this, but the codebase was not designed with multithreading in mind and I would need to do a lot of extra work, I will probably just write a new ray tracer with multithreading being one of the criteria from the start.
